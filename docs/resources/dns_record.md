## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) The content or value of the DNS record (e.g. an IP address or hostname).
- `domain_identifier` (String) The identifier of the domain this DNS record belongs to. Changing this forces a new resource.
- `name` (String) The name of the DNS record (e.g. subdomain or @ for root).
- `type` (String) The type of the DNS record (e.g. A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT). Changing this forces a new resource.

### Optional

- `ttl` (Number) The time-to-live of the DNS record in seconds. Defaults to 3600 if not specified.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The composite identifier of the DNS record (domain_identifier/type/name).
